The GPL license, referenced below, applies to the following elements of this project:
* New files, documentation, and elements created by Georgia State University;
* Portions of a derivative work created by Georgia State University (for example, patch files);
* To the extent to which this project is considered a derivative work, the entire compilation.

This project contains existing open-source software and publicly-documented know-how (collectively, "the existing items").
The Authors & Sources section of the ReadMe.md file in this directory lists these components, their locations,
and licenses.  Where practical, we have documented sources for know-how except for when generally
known to those skilled in the art or otherwise in the public domain.

We believe the existing items are licensed to the public in a manner consistent with the creation of a derivative
work which can be licensed under the terms of the GPL, referenced below.  This license in no way
restricts your rights to the existing items.
